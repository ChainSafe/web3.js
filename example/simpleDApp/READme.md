# Simple Decentralized Application
Here is a dead simple contract + web3.js DApp. The contract is contract.sol and it is currently on the ropsten testnet at 0xEcb2eA404cb3226781500d655140063e20dA07C6
The contract, along with its source code can be found on ropsten.etherscan.com [here.](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xecb2ea404cb3226781500d655140063e20da07c6)
## How to run
You can run this example by setting up a local server using [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) depending on your operating system.
Once your local server is set up, you will need to place the entire web3.js repository into the server directory:(wamp64\www) for WAMP and (htdocs) for MAMP. You will also need a web3 such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). (Make sure that your metamask client is set to the ropsten test-net). You will also probably need some Ropsten eth, which you can get [here](http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/). Once this is all set up you can open it http://localhost/web3.js/example/simpleDApp/
