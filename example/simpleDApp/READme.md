# Simple Decentralized Application
Here is a dead simple contract + web3.js DApp
## How to run
You can run this example by setting up a local server using [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) depending on your operating system.
Once your local server is set up, you will need to place the entire web3.js repository into the server directory:(wamp64\www) for WAMP and (htdocs) for MAMP. You will also need a web3 such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). Once this is all set up you can open it http://localhost/web3.js/example/simpleDApp/
