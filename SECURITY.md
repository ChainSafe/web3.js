## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please create dependabot alerts to make github aware of vulnerabilities.
Recommended remedies will be applied.

Supply as much information as possible to help with remediation and/or further support. Recommended 'remediation' measures should be labeled with exact modifications needed for your bug.
