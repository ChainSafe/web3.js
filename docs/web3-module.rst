==========
Module API
==========

The ``Module API`` gives you the possibility to create your **own custom Web3 Module** with JSON-RPC methods, subscriptions, or contracts.
The provided modules from the Web3 library are also written with the ``Module API`` the core does provide.

The goal of the ``Module API`` is to provide the possibility to extend and customize the JSON-RPC methods, contracts, and subscriptions
to project specific classes with a similar kind of API the DApp developer knows from the Web3.js library.
It's possible with the Web3 Module API to create complex contract APIs and tools for the development of a DApp.

These are the core modules which are providing all the classes for the Web3 Module API.
